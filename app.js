// First, create a separate JS object literal (no constructor functions... yet)
// for each shop location that does the following:
  // Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer,
  // in object properties
  // Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers
  // per hour. Objects/Math/random
  // Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for
  // each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the
  // random number of customers generated
  // Store the results for each location in a separate array...
  // perhaps as a property of the object representing that location
  // Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser
  // Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location
  // should look as shown in assignment
  // Display the lists on sales.html. We will be adding features to this
  // application and working with its layout throughout the week.
